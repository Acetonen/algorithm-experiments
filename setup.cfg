;[Workflow]
;This section describes how to work with mutmut to enhance your test suite.
;
;1. Run mutmut with mutmut run. A full run is preferred but if you're just getting started you can exit in the middle
;and start working with what you have found so far.
;2. Show the mutants with mutmut results
;3. Apply a surviving mutant to disk running mutmut apply 3 (replace 3 with the relevant mutant ID from mutmut results)
;4. Write a new test that fails
;5. Revert the mutant on disk
;6. Rerun the new test to see that it now passes
;7. Go back to point 2.
;
;Mutmut keeps a result cache in .mutmut-cache so if you want to make sure you run a full mutmut run just delete this file.
